        <h2>Text: Time and Mark</h2>
            <h3>Time</h3>
            <dl>
                <dd>The time tag can be used to make dates and times. Such as <time datetime="2021-6-1">Tuesday 1st June 2021</time>
                In addition to dates you can also put times using a 24 hour clock. For example: <time datetime="12:45">12:45</time></dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Mark</h3>
            <dl>
                <dd>You can highlight text using the <mark>mark</mark> tag.</dd>
            </dl>

        <h2>Conditional Comments</h2>
            <dl>
                <dd><mark>Conditional Comments</mark> are just HTML comments that are used by older versions of Internet
                Explorer that are meant to help it produce the output desired for the web page.</dd>
                <dd>They are also used in CSS to fix holes in these older browsers display capabilities.</dd>
                <dd>Before using them think about what the users are going to be using and what makes the most sense
                for you to support. For example, the vast majority of people aren't using Internet Explorer 6 anymore.</dd>
            </dl>

        <h2>Tables: Columns, Headers, and Footers</h2>
            <h3>Columns, Caption, Header, Footer</h3>
            <p>
                The colgroup tag is used to help style the table with the use of CSS. You can give each column a class
                and use that class in CSS to style just that column.<br>
                You can use the span tag if you want multiple columns to look the same. (Don't use a col tag for the 
                columns that the span is including.)<br>
                The caption tag is always used at the beginning of the table. CSS caption-side: left, right, or bottom
                will move it where you would expect.<br>
                The thead, tfoot, tbody tags allow you to separate the table into header, footer, and body parts.
