        <h2>Text: Time and Mark</h2>
            <h3>Time</h3>
            <dl>
                <dd>The time tag can be used to make dates and times. Such as <time datetime="2021-6-1">Tuesday 1st June 2021</time>
                In addition to dates you can also put times using a 24 hour clock. For example: <time datetime="12:45">12:45</time></dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Mark</h3>
            <dl>
                <dd>You can highlight text using the <mark>mark</mark> tag.</dd>
            </dl>

        <h2>Conditional Comments</h2>
            <dl>
                <dd><mark>Conditional Comments</mark> are just HTML comments that are used by older versions of Internet
                Explorer that are meant to help it produce the output desired for the web page.</dd>
                <dd>They are also used in CSS to fix holes in these older browsers display capabilities.</dd>
                <dd>Before using them think about what the users are going to be using and what makes the most sense
                for you to support. For example, the vast majority of people aren't using Internet Explorer 6 anymore.</dd>
