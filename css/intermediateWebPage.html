        <h1>CSS Intermediate Web Page</h1>

        <h2>Class and ID and Selectors</h2>
        <dl id="list">
            <dd><p class="data">Selectors come in 3 forms: HTML Tag, class, and ID. Class and ID allow you to define your own 
            selectors. This allows you to have the same HTML element presented differently from its counterparts.
            <br>In CSS the class selector is preceded by a full stop "." then the class name. 
            While an ID selector is preceded by a "#".</p></dd>
            <dd><p class="data">In CSS you can also apply a selector to a specific HTML element by doing element.class or element.id.</p>
            <p class="other">For example p.list will only be applied to paragraph elements within the list class.</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Grouping and Nesting</h2>
        <dl id="groupnest">
            <dd><p>Two ways to simplify HTML and CSS while also making it easier to manage</p></dd>
            <dd>Grouping allows for you to combine multiple selectors under one group and give each selector the attributes within it.</dd>
            <dd><p>Nesting allows you to specify properties to selectors within other selectors.</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
        <dl id="pseudo">
            <dd>Purpose: to specify a state or relation to the selector it is attached to.</dd>
            <dd>Most basic use is on a link to say if it was visited yet or not.</dd>
            <dd><a href="http://htmldog.com">HTML Dog</a></dd>
            <dd><h3>Dynamic Pseudo Class</h3></dd>
            <dd>Can be used to apply styles when something happens to something. Also commonly used for links.</dd>
            <dd>Three main classes:</dd>
            <ol>
                <li>active - used when something is activated by the user, such as a link being clicked on</li>
                <li>hover - used when something is passed over by an input from the user, such as a cursor moving over a link</li>
                <li>focus - used when something gains focus, when it is ready for or selected by for keyboard input</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most often used for form elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <dd>Another class is the <mark>first-child</mark> class. Its purpose is to target something only if it is the very first descendant of an element.</dd>
            <dd>There are also last-child, target, and first-of-type classes to name a few more.</dd>
        </dl>
