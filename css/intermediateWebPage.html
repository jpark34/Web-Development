            <dd><p>Selectors come in 3 forms: HTML Tag, class, and ID. Class and ID allow you to define your own 
            selectors. This allows you to have the same HTML element presented differently from its counterparts.
            <br>In CSS the class selector is preceded by a full stop "." then the class name. 
            While an ID selector is preceded by a "#".</dd></dd>
